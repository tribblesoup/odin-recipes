        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <h4>Make the Meat Filling</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Add the oil to a large skillet and place it over 
                medium-high heat for 2 minutes. Add the onions. Cook 5 
                minutes, stirring occasionally.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add the ground beef (or ground lamb) to the skillet and 
                break it apart with a wooden spoon. Add the parsley, 
                rosemary, thyme, salt, and pepper. Stir well. Cook for 6-8 
                minutes, until the meat is browned, stirring occasionally.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add the Worcestershire sauce and garlic. Stir to combine. 
                Cook for 1 minute.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add the flour and tomato paste. Stir until well 
                incorporated and no clumps of tomato paste remain.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add the broth, peas, carrots, and corn. Bring the liquid 
                to a boil then reduce to simmer. Simmer for 5 minutes, 
                stirring occasionally.
            </li>
            <li>
                Set the meat mixture aside. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Make the Potato Topping</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Place the potatoes in a large pot. Cover the potatoes 
                with water. Bring the water to a boil. Reduce to a 
                simmer. Cook until potatoes are fork tnder, 10-15 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Drain the potatoes in a colander. Return the potatoes to 
                the hot pot. Let the potatoes rest in the hot pot for 1 
                minute to evaporate any remaining liquid.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add butter, half &amp; half, garlic powder, salt, and 
                pepper. Mash the potatoes and stir until all the 
                ingredients are mixed together.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add the parmesan cheese to the potatoes. Stir until well 
                combined.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Assemble the Casserole</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Pour the meat mixture into a baking dish. Spread it out 
                into an even layer. Spoon the mashed potatoes on top of 
                the meat. Carefully spread into an even layer.
            </li>
            <li>
                If the baking disk looks very full, place it on a rimmed 
                baking sheet so that the filling doesn't bubble over into 
                your oven. Bake uncovered for 25-30 minutes. Cool for 15 
                minutes before serving.
            </li>
        </ol>

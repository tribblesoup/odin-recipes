            <li>3 tablespoons curry paste</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons minced garlic</li>
            <li>1 (3/4 inch thick) slice of ginger, minced</li>
            <li>1 1/4 pounds skinless, boneless chicken breast meat - cubed</li>
            <li>1/3 cup peanut butter</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons brown sugar</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons tamarind paste</li>
            <li>3 cups cubed potatoes</li>
            <li>2 cups sliced and quartered carrots</li>
            <li>3 cups of cut baby corn</li>
            <li>1 (13.5 ounce) can coconut milk</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons fresh lime juice</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Heat vegetable oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. 
                Stir in curry paste, minced garlic, and minced ginger; 
                cook and stir for 2 minutes. Add in cubed chicken, and 
                cook until the pieces turn white on the outside, about 
                3 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Mix in peanut butter, brown sugar, and tamarind paste, 
                stirring to combine. Add potatoes, carrots, baby corn, 
                and coconut milk. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to 
                medium-low, cover, and simmer until the potatoes are 
                tender and the chicken pieces are no longer pink in the 
                center, about 20 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add lime juice and cook for an additional 5 minutes 
                before serving.
            </li>
        </ol>
